# File Content

This is a helper package, and it can't be used independently. Its purpose is to get/set/modify files' content when they are created/deleted/updated through the commands that are shipped with the packages, which are part of [**Packagified Laravel**](https://github.com/bulentAkgul/packagified-laravel).

#### DISCLAIMER

It should be production-ready but hasn't been tested enough. You should use it carefully since this package will manipulate your files and folders. Always use a version-control, and make sure you have [**File History**](https://github.com/bulentAkgul/file-history) to be able to roll back the changes.
